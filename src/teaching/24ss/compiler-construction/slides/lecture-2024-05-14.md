# Conditionals

Changes to  the transformation pipeline

## Shrink

* remove `and` and `or` in favor of conditional expression

```
if not cond: sethen else: seelse
--->
if cond: seelse else: sethen
```

## Transformation to monadic form

output grammar `ast_ir_mon`

```python
type ExprAtom = EConst | EVar 
type Expr = ExprAtom | EOp1 | EOp2 | EInput | ECompare
type Stmt = SPrint | SAssign | SCond
type Program = IList[Stmt]
```

* expression conditional eliminated
* arguments to `EOp1`, `EOp2`,  `ECompare`, and `SPrint` are atomic
* expression arguments to `SAssign`, `SCond` are not atomic
* condition of `if` should always be a comparison
  
## Explication of control (5.7)

input  grammar `ast_ir_mon`
output grammar `ast_ir_mon_exp`

```python
type ExprAtom = EConst | EVar 
type Expr = ExprAtom | EOp1 | EOp2 | EInput | ECompare
type Stmt = SPrint | SAssign | SCond | SGoto
type Block = IList[Stmt]
type Program = dict[Label, Block]

class SCond:
    test: ECompare
    body: Label
    orelse: Label

class SGoto:
    target: Label
```

* statement lists in conditional replaced by jump labels (here: `Label`)
* New goto statement

Write two functions

```python
def explicate(p: src.Program) -> tuple[tgt.Program, Label, Label]:
def explicate_block(out: tgt.Program, Lentry: Label, Lexit: Label, p: src.Program):
```

* `explicate` creates a program dictionary and entry and exit labels
* `explicate_block`
  * traverses a block for a conditional
  * introduces labels for the true branch, the false branch and the
    continuation (the code following the conditional)
  * recursively invokes `explicate_block` to translate the true branch
    and the false branch
  * emits the new `SCond` and inserts the proper `SGoto`s
  * `SCond` finishes a block, so we have to start a new block using
    the continuation label

Roughly:
```
SCond( test, body, orelse )
... more code ...
-->

SCond( test, Ltrue, Lfalse )

Ltrue:
   code for body
   SGoto Lcont
   
Lfalse:
   code for orelse
   SGoto LCont

Lcont:
   explicate ... more code ...
```

## Instruction Selection (5.8)

* raise from single block to dict of blocks
* all conditional statements with comparison have the shape  like this
  `if a1 == a2: goto ltrue; else goto lfalse`
  with atoms `a1` and `a2` so we can generate a conditional branch instruction
* for reifying the result of a comparison in, say, a boolean variable
  check the instructions `slt` and `sltu`

## Register Allocation (5.9)

* need to update liveness analysis
* works on _control flow graph_

### Control Flow Graph (CFG)

A directed graph with 

* nodes = *basic blocks*, i.e., a sequence of instructions starting with a label
  and ending with a (conditional) jump.
* edges = from block ending with a jump to `L` to block starting with
  label `L`

* Each block has either one or two outgoing edges.
* Each block has one or more incoming edges.

* One node is labeled `entry`, the label `exit` points to the
  conclusion of the code.

### Liveness Analysis

* currently, the CFG is a DAG
* for each node labeled `L` in the CFG, we maintain sets of variables
  `live_after(L)` and `live_before(L)`
* initially all sets are empty

* process all nodes in reverse topological order, i.e., the nodes pointing
  to `exit` first
* liveness analysis for node `L`:
  * set `live_after(L)` to `live_before(L1)` U ... U `live_before(Ln)`
    where `L1` ... `Ln` are the immediate successors of `L` in the CFG
  * calculate `live_before(L)` by transforming `live_after(L)`
    according to the gen/kill rules of liveness analysis

* may calculate the interference right away without storing
  `live_after` for each individual instruction

## Optimize Blocks / Remove Jumps

* the material of 5.12.1 is not obviously applicable to our approach
* but the same effect can be achieved using the approach of 5.12.2 or
  by partially evaluating conditionals earlier in the pipeline

# While

##  control flow graph for summation from 0-5


    mainstart
	    |
	   block5
	/    ^     \
	|    |      |
	block7     block8
	            |
			   exit
			   
* it's cyclic
* no traversal in topological order possible
* set up liveness information as before
* compute `live_before` from `live_after` until no `live_before`
  changes.
* called _fixed point iteration_
  
For instance, suppose `sum` is live in `block8`.
-> sum in `live_after(block5)`
-> sum in `live_before(block5)`
-> `live_after(block7) = live_before(block5)` which contains `sum`
-> `sum` in `live_before(block7)`

* it's also correct to compute the interference graph during the fixed
  point iteration
  
  
Suppose `LA(ins)` is some life after set.
Consider instruction `ins` and `LB(ins)` the corresponding life before
set.

If `LA(ins)` gets bigger, then `LB(ins)` stays the same or gets
bigger.
Because `LB(ins) =  (LA(ins) \ W(ins)) U R(ins)` 
where `W(ins)` and `R(ins)` are constant sets (because the instruction
`ins` is fixed).
So technically, this computes a _monotone function_.
